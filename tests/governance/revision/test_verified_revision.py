"""Tests for verified revision-target selection (ADR-0064).

``select_verified_revision_target`` differs from ``select_revision_target`` by
checking that the fact it picks actually restores consistency, instead of trusting
the lowest-confidence atom in the UNSAT core. These tests drive it through the real
solver: rules are parsed with ``parse_fof`` and the core is produced by
``check_consistency`` (not hand-built), so the whiff cases exercise genuine forward
chaining and exclusion propagation.
