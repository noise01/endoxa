"""Deductive belief verification: the pure ``entails`` refutation query.

``verify_belief`` grounds a belief by asking whether it is entailed by the
current beliefs under the active rules. These pure tests exercise that query at
the domain seam: entailment via a rule, a counter-model, a face-value belief
excluded from its own proof, and the inconclusive verdicts (budget
cut / unparseable target).
