"""Anytime deliberation budget: bound the E-matching loop in rounds and in work.

The meta-control arbiter caps how many E-matching rounds a slow S2 consistency
check may spend. These pure tests exercise the
engine/domain seam: a non-terminating matching loop is cut and reported as
``"UNKNOWN"``, while well-behaved checks converge unaffected.

``max_rounds`` alone does not bound a check, because the cap is only tested once
``match()`` has returned. A soak run stalled for 64 minutes inside a *single*
round, so ``max_matches`` bounds the candidate bindings the
search may examine. Its tests assert on the engine's own counters rather than on
wall-clock time, so they stay deterministic and need no ``benchmark`` marker.
