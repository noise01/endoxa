"""Every exported signature can be read back at runtime.

Shipping ``py.typed`` and the ``Typing :: Typed`` classifier is a promise that
the annotations in here are usable. Under PEP 649 an annotation is evaluated when
something reads it -- ``typing.get_type_hints``, ``inspect.signature``, a
dataclass adapter, a docs generator -- and a name imported only under
``if TYPE_CHECKING`` is not there when that happens.

The package was published twice with 26 of its 63 exported callables raising
``NameError`` on ``get_type_hints``: the whole solver construction API, five of
governance, every windowed calibration function. Nothing failed at import and
nothing failed in a test, because none of it is read unless someone reads it.

The list of modules is read off the source tree rather than written down here. A
list would have to be kept in step with the package, and a check that silently
stops covering a new module is the shape of thing this file exists to prevent.
