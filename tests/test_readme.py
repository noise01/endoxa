"""The example in the README runs, and does what the README says it does.

The README is the project page on the index as well as the front of the
repository, so a snippet that no longer matches the API is the first thing a new
reader meets. Nothing was checking it, and it had drifted twice over: the rule
took a confidence the example never passed, and the formula was missing the stop
that ends a TPTP sentence. Both would have gone out with the first release.
