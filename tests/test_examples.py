"""The examples run, and still say what their prose says they say.

An example is a promise made in public, and the README already demonstrated how
quietly one rots: its snippet had been broken twice over and nothing noticed
until someone tried to install the package. So these are executed here as a
reader would execute them -- as scripts, from the repository root -- and the
numbers their prose points at are asserted, not just their exit codes.

The enumeration checks itself. A fourth example added without a row below would
otherwise be the one nobody runs.
