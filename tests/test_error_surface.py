"""Everything this package raises on its own behalf is an ``EndoxaError``.

Stated as a rule in ``endoxa/errors.py``, and a rule nothing checks holds until
the next person who has not read it. This reads every ``raise`` in the source and
every escape route out of the package, rather than trusting the convention.

The rule earns its keep at one place in particular. A grammar library sits under
the TPTP front end, and before this its exceptions came out of ``govern`` --
so handling a typo in a rule meant importing ``lark`` to name the type, and
pinning a dependency this package documents as an internal detail.
