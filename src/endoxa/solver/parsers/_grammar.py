"""The TPTP grammar, and everything that needs the parser library to exist.

Split from :mod:`~endoxa.solver.parsers.tptp` so that importing this package does
not build a parser. Compiling the grammar and loading the library it comes from
cost about seventy milliseconds, and they were paid at import by every caller --
including one that only reads a ledger, and one that only counts Brier scores,
neither of which parses anything.

Imported on the first parse instead, once, and held by ``sys.modules`` after
that. Nothing outside this module names the grammar library.
