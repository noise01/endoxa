"""A self-contained SMT engine, and the public facade for it.

Satisfiability modulo theories with assumption-based solving and unsat cores, an
equality (EUF) theory, quantifier instantiation by E-matching under explicit
budgets, and a TPTP front end. It depends on nothing else in endoxa.

A check answers three ways -- ``"SAT"``, ``"UNSAT"``, or ``"UNKNOWN"`` when a
budget ran out. The third is a real answer rather than a failure: deliberation is
*anytime*, so a matching loop that could run unbounded is cut and reported as
undetermined instead of hanging. ``"UNSAT"`` stays sound however the search was
cut short, because a contradiction derived from the ground clauses does not
depend on instantiation having finished.

Correctness is asserted differentially against Z3 rather than by this package's
own tests alone; those tests are dev-only and are not shipped.

External callers should import from ``endoxa.solver`` directly rather than reaching
into submodules. Modules *inside* this package keep their deep imports to avoid
import cycles (``parsers.tptp`` depends on ``api``).
