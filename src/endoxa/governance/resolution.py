"""What the governance layer decides to do next.

:mod:`~endoxa.governance.ledger` says what happened and
:mod:`~endoxa.governance.view` says what is currently the case. This
module is the third face: **given a set of beliefs and the constraints they live
under, which ledger operations does governance perform?**

Without it the contract is only half a contract. An external host can read a
ledger, but reading is not being governed -- to be governed it has to be able to
hand its beliefs over and get back "retract this one", "supersede that one",
"these two cannot be separated, hold both". Those answers are exactly the seven
operations, so the decision surface returns :class:`~endoxa.governance.ledger.LedgerOp`
rather than a bespoke verdict type.

**This is wiring, not new judgement.** Every decision below is made by the same
pure functions a host would otherwise have to call itself, in the same order and
under the same conditions. What changes is *where the order lives*: written out by
hand in each caller, it is a wiring that gets fixed once and stays broken
everywhere else.

**Scope: the belief tier.** Beliefs, learned rules and the ties between them --
the ledger's primary object. Production additionally
arbitrates *acquired links* (``find_link_culprits``), which
the ledger deliberately keeps separate. So
this surface does not reduce production to a single call, and it is not meant to:
whether the two ledgers are ever shown as one view is a later judgement.

**Input is text.** Rules and hard constraints arrive as TPTP axiom strings and
are parsed here. A host that had to build ``Expr`` objects would need the solver
library to speak to governance at all; taking text keeps the contract something a
foreign host can satisfy with a string.

Depends only on the bundled solver (:mod:`endoxa.solver`) and on this package's own
revision logic (:mod:`endoxa.governance.revision`).
