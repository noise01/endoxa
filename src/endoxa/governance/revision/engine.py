    :func:`select_revision_target` picks the lowest-confidence fallible atom in the
    UNSAT core by TMS policy but never checks that flipping it resolves the clash.
    When a rule immediately re-derives that atom -- a consequent still forced by an
    asserted antecedent -- the flip is a no-op and the contradiction persists. Call
    that a *whiff*: the selector swings at the conflict and the conflict is still
    there. Whiffs become common as soon as exclusion links make independent
    contradictions common. This selector verifies each candidate, in the same
    preference order (hypotheses first, then lowest confidence), and returns the
    first whose flip genuinely restores satisfiability.

    The re-check is scoped to the conflict's *own* sub-theory: the beliefs that share
    an individual with a core atom (its argument terms), plus the core atoms
    themselves. A propositional theory decomposes by constant, so several
    independent contradictions can co-exist with no single global flip restoring full
    satisfiability; verifying against the whole belief set would then reject every
    per-constant fix. Scoping to the shared-individual cluster keeps the rule
    antecedents that could re-derive a flipped atom (so real whiffs are still caught)
    while excluding unrelated conflicts on other individuals (resolved on later
    beats). Equality-coupled individuals (EUF) pull each other into the
    cluster through the equality atoms the solver placed in the core.

    The re-check also asserts the link-derived ground clauses, *re-synthesized
    from each trial belief set* rather than reused from the detection pass:
    a flip can satisfy the clause that fired while creating a new clash, and only
    re-synthesis sees that. Because every synthesized clause is one the belief set
    currently violates, their count measures how much clash remains, which gives the
    fallback below its progress criterion.

    The search runs **band by band**. A band is a run of candidates the
    preference ranks identically, and every member of a band is checked before the
    band is judged -- no early return. One candidate settling the conflict wins
    outright, exactly as before. *Two or more* settling it means the preference has
    nothing left to say about which should go, and the function returns None rather
    than take whichever the UNSAT core happened to name first. Being unsettleable is
    a failure of the preference, not of the solver, so the tie question path
    (:mod:`endoxa.governance.revision.tie`) picks it up from there. A band where
    nothing settles falls through to the next one, so a whiffed low-confidence band
    still yields to a higher-confidence fix.

    When no band settles anything -- a functional-exclusion pile-up of three or more
    values leaves a clash behind whichever single atom is flipped -- the first
    candidate (in the same preference order) that *strictly reduces* the link
    clash count is taken instead. Tie detection is deliberately **not** applied to
    this fallback: returning None here would not raise a question either (a pile-up
    fails the tie path's pair gate) and would only cost the "each contradiction is
    resolved on its own beat" progress. The choice is still deterministic,
    because the candidate order is. A no-op flip never qualifies, so
    genuine whiffs are still rejected.
