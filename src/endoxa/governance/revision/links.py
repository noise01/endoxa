"""Turning predicate links into clauses the consistency check can see.

A clash between single-valued predicates can be detected the moment it happens,
but the SMT consistency check has no way to *represent* one: exclusion between
predicates is not part of the axiom set, so the solver answers SAT and revision
never fires. This module closes that gap by synthesising the clauses.

For a predicate declared single-valued, two atoms that share their leading
arguments but differ in the final value cannot both hold, so the ground clause
``Not(And(atomA, atomB))`` is emitted for each such pair currently held true.
Both atoms being asserted is what makes that clause directly UNSAT without any
unique-names assumption: the values are compared as strings and differ, so term
distinctness is settled before the clause is built. This deliberately sidesteps
the question of *fallible* equality between terms -- moving to the general axiom
``forall x, y, z. P(x, y) & P(x, z) -> y = z`` with a defeasible ``Not(Eq(...))``
would reopen it.

The same "detected but unrepresentable" gap holds for the other link forms, so
their clause synthesis lives here too. :func:`inter_predicate_exclusion_clauses`
(pairwise antonym or exclusion class) and :func:`implication_clauses` (defeasible
implication) build their constraints from the links rather than from
configuration, but are otherwise the same ground-clause construction.

Those three are *violation* clauses: each is emitted only for a constraint the
belief set currently breaks, which is what a contradiction check and its revision
need to see. :func:`backward_implication_clauses` is the one *derivation* clause
source here. A verification query asks whether a target follows, not whether
something is broken, so the violation gate would emit nothing and leave the links
invisible to it; this walks the implication links backwards from the target
instead. The distinction is narrow and it matters: every tier must read the same
*link set*, not synthesise the same *clauses* from it.

Pure: stdlib, the sibling :mod:`.facts`, :mod:`endoxa.solver`, and the atom grammar
in :mod:`endoxa.syntax`. Clauses are built from the belief *node-id strings* via
:func:`parse_fact_to_expr`, the same parser :func:`.engine.build_assumptions`
uses, so a synthesised clause's atom expressions are identical to the assumption
expressions and the solver correlates them.

    Verifying a belief asks whether an atom follows from the rest of them under
    the active constraints. Given only the axiom set, a consequence that the
    *links* license comes back as not entailed: a system can derive ``p(c)`` from
    a link ``q => p`` on the detection side and still fail to confirm it on the
    SMT side. That asymmetry makes a whole class of derivations invisible to
    verification.

    :func:`implication_clauses` cannot fill the gap. It gates on a *violated*
    implication -- antecedent true, consequent held false -- because emitting an
    implication for an absent consequent would let the solver derive it, which is
    forward materialisation rather than contradiction resolution. In a
    verification query the target is dropped from the assumptions in both
    polarities and is not held false, so that gate emits nothing.
    Derivation is exactly what this query wants, so this synthesizer inverts the walk:
    start at the target and collect the links that could conclude it.

    Walks ``implication_targets`` *backwards* from the target's predicate to the
    transitive closure of its antecedents (breadth-first, each predicate expanded
    once so a cyclic link set terminates), emitting the ground implication for every
    edge reached on the target's own argument tuple -- implication is stated over the

    closure rather than one hop keeps "can the system verify what it owns" from
    depending on the shape of the link graph: ``r => q => p`` must verify ``p`` from
    ``r`` the same way one hop does. The cost is linear in the reachable link count.

    The verification invariant holds: the clauses are implications *toward* the target, never
    the target as a premise, so nothing here lets ``target`` prove itself. Exclusion
    links are deliberately not supplied -- ``Not(And(p, q))`` yields the entailment of
