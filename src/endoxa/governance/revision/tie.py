"""Contradiction ties that no revision can settle, turned into a question.

The exclusion and implication tiers resolve every contradiction the solver can
decide (..). What they deliberately leave alone is the *tie*:
two beliefs of equal standing whose conflict has no cheaper side. Three RFCs
 settled on holding both rather than
retracting one arbitrarily -- picking a side between two equally certain claims
would be arbitrariness, not calibration.

Holding both is right; staying silent about it is not. Before this module the
tie surfaced only as a warning log in
a warning log on the host's side.
This module decides when a tie is well-formed enough to ask the user about, and
what each answer would have to ground for the answer to actually settle it.

Scope: **any pair the revision preference cannot separate** -- two beliefs
sharing a preference band (:mod:`.preference`). An earlier form of this gate had
only the 1.0 case to generalise from and was written as "both inviolable"; 1.0 is
now one band among others. What that newly admits is every *fallible*
equal-confidence pair, and since ``interlocutor_confidence`` is a constant, that
means every clash between two things the user said.

Pure and basis-independent (governance tier): stdlib + sibling
domain modules only.

    """Decide whether a contradiction is a tie worth asking the user about (§5).

    Called where revision gave up: every fact, link and rule candidate was
    exhausted without a target. That branch covers more than ties (a conflict
    among rule instances alone names no belief at all), so the tie test is made
    here rather than read off the absent decision.

    Three conditions, in order:

    1. The core names **exactly two** held beliefs. Zero means there
       is nobody to ask about; three or more is a pile-up that one yes/no cannot
       settle.
    2. **The preference cannot separate them**: they share a band,
       and they are not hypotheses. An unequal pair got settled by revision and
       never reaches here.
    3. **Both completions are SAT** (§5). The affirmative answer and the negative
       answer each have to actually restore consistency. Asking a question whose
       answer leaves the contradiction standing spends the user's time and comes
       straight back on the next beat; this is the same discipline the verified
       revision target applies to a flip, moved in front of
       the question.

    The sub-theory both completions are checked against is built exactly as
    :func:`~endoxa.governance.revision.engine.select_verified_revision_target`
    builds it: every belief sharing an individual with a core atom, plus the core
    atoms themselves. Link clauses are re-synthesised per trial so the
    check sees the same constraints the detection did.

    Condition 3 restates, from the answer's side, what the revision selector
    already found from the flip's side: ``node_a`` flipping to SAT and the "no"
    completion being SAT are the same fact. So a pair that selector declined as
    unsettleable always passes here, and a pair where only one flip settles never
    arrives. Checking it twice is not redundancy but a wedge: if either
    side is ever changed alone, the correspondence breaks where a test can see it.

    Args:
        unsat_core: The conflicting expressions the solver returned.
        beliefs: The full belief snapshot (node ID -> data).
        expr_to_node_id: Mapping produced by ``build_assumptions``.
        rule_exprs: The active rule expressions (hard constraints for the re-check).
        max_rounds: Optional E-matching round cap; an ``"UNKNOWN"`` re-check is
            treated conservatively as not settling the tie, so no question is asked.
        links: The link sources whose ground clauses constrain the re-check.

        not a well-formed, answerable tie.
