"""What the revision preference says about a belief, derived in one place.

Two selectors read the same preference: :mod:`~endoxa.governance.revision.engine`
picks which belief to retract, and :mod:`~endoxa.governance.revision.tie` decides
when no belief can be picked and the user has to be asked instead. They are two
faces of one judgement -- "does the preference separate these beliefs?" -- and
writing the derivation twice would let one of them be fixed alone.

The unit of that judgement is the **band**: beliefs the preference ranks
identically. Being unsettleable is not the solver failing to decide, it is the
*preference* failing to decide -- so it is a property of a band, not of a
confidence value. Confidence 1.0 is then just one band among others, which is
why band equality can replace the older "both inviolable" tie gate, which had
only the 1.0 case to generalise from.

Pure and basis-independent (governance tier): stdlib only.
