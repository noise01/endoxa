"""The current view as a derivation of the ledger.

**The current view is derived from the ledger.** Fold the operation series and
what comes out is what the agent holds -- including the beliefs it holds *without
deciding between them*.

``UNRESOLVED`` is the point of the exercise. Being unable to settle a
contradiction is a real state, and a system can speak about it by asking, but it
usually has no name in the state itself: a held tie is indistinguishable from two
ordinary beliefs that happen to conflict. Here it is a value of
:attr:`BeliefState.status`, and both sides carry it.

**Releasing a hold is derived, never asserted.** A hold is not a lock. It is the
name of "the preference cannot separate these two", so it ends when the
preference *can* -- when a later operation moves one side out of the other's
band. :attr:`BeliefState.released_by` reads back which operation did it.

**Only ``ground`` confers 1.0.** That makes a grounded answer the one operation
which always separates a band, and therefore the one that directly releases a
hold. Evidence can release a hold too, but only by actually moving a credence --
which is the difference between settling a tie and outranking it.

**On replaying the Laplace fold.** ``confirm`` and ``refute`` carry no
confidence: a booking says only which way the evidence points, and the credence
is computed wherever it was booked. To reconstruct a view that can be *checked*
against the host's own state, this module replays the same arithmetic. That
duplicates a rule the host also holds, and it is deliberate: a view that gave up
on confidence could not tell a correct derivation from one that had lost half its
evidence.

Pure and dependency-free: stdlib only.

    What is wanted is zero disagreement between the view the ledger reconstructs
    and what the host actually holds. Several numbers rather than one, because
    they fail for different reasons and blurring them would
    hide the interesting one.

    ``UNRESOLVED`` has no counterpart here, and that is not an omission: **the
    belief store cannot represent a hold**. Two beliefs the preference could not
    separate sit on it as two ordinary beliefs, which is the gap the derived view
    closes. There is nothing on the other side for the ledger's status to be
    checked against, so it is pinned by a positive control rather than by this
    comparison.

    Attributes:
        compared: Targets checked on both sides.
        truth_breaks: Targets whose truth value disagrees. **This is the
            invariant**: a non-zero count means the derivation misread an
            operation.
        confidence_breaks: Targets whose credence disagrees among those whose
            evidence the ledger could fully account for.
        unattributed: Targets excluded from the credence comparison because the
            two sides' evidence tallies disagree. **Expected to be zero** once the
            write side records every credence move it makes. Two things can still
            put a target here, and they are not
            the same:

            - **A regression in the recording path.** A booking the belief store folded
              and did not record, or recorded and did not fold. Either way the
              write side and the ledger have come apart again.
            - **A restore that brought no tally back.** The ledger keeps a
              belief's whole series, so a belief that returned to the belief store
              without its counts reads as saying less than the audit log can
              account for. Paging carries the tally now, which is what
              made this column an invariant rather than a residual; what remains
              are the restores whose source has no tally to give -- an entry
              persists a proposition, not its evidence. Paging itself
              is still not a ledger operation: the fix was to
              stop the belief store forgetting, not to teach the ledger to forget.

            Note the test is a disagreement, not an inequality: the ledger
            holding *more* than the belief store lands here too, which is what makes
            the second case visible at all.
        missing_from_state: Targets the ledger knows that the belief store no longer
            has -- paged out to LTM or evicted. Excluded from the
