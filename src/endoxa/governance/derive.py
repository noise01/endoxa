"""Recovering the ledger from what the host already records.

The separation this rests on is between *the source of truth on the API* and
*the source of truth in the implementation*: the ledger is the former, a host's
own stores stay the latter. This module is what makes that separation cost
nothing at the write side -- it is a **read-only derivation** of the operation
series from a host's persisted audit log. No write path changes; the ledger is a
way of reading what already happened.

**Why the event log and not the current state.** The current state alone cannot
yield the series: a retraction is a flip that leaves no trace of the flip, and
checking a reconstruction needs a series to reconstruct *from*. An audit log is
the only place a host keeps the order of what it did, so it is the primary
input; the host's own state is what the derived view is then checked against
(:func:`~endoxa.governance.view.compare_to_state`).

**The horizon.** A host that prunes its audit log by event type can have had
governance operations swept out from under it, and a derivation that stayed
silent about that would be claiming a completeness it does not have.
:class:`DerivedLedger` therefore reports the horizon -- the earliest row it saw
-- rather than pretending the series starts at the beginning of time.

**Keeping the ledger-bearing types does not retire the horizon.** A retention
policy acts *forward*: what was already swept cannot be un-swept, and a host
remains free to configure one that keeps less. So the horizon keeps meaning
exactly what it always meant -- the earliest row this derivation could read,
which is not a claim of completeness.

**Reading the host's event names.** This package may not import a host's own
event definitions -- it has to work against a host it was never built for -- so
the event type names live here as string constants. The host owes the other half
of that bargain: a test on its side pinning these strings against whatever it
actually emits, because a rename it never notices silently empties the ledger.

Pure and dependency-free: the input is the raw row shape a host's event store
returns.
