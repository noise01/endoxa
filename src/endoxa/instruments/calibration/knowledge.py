"""Pure knowledge-calibration accounting for the self-model's epistemic facet.

Tracks how often the self-model's ``known``/non-``known`` classifications hold
up over time: a target once classified ``known`` that
later leaves ``known`` is an overconfidence signal; a target once classified
non-``known`` that later becomes ``known`` is a confirmation signal. The actor
wiring lives in a host; this module is unit-testable in
isolation.
