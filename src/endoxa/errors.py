"""What this package raises, and one name that catches all of it.

A caller who wants to handle a bad rule string has to be able to name the thing
that gets raised. Before this module the answer was ``lark.exceptions.UnexpectedToken``:
the grammar library reached through :func:`~endoxa.solver.parse_fof` and out of
:func:`~endoxa.governance.govern`, so handling a typo in an axiom meant importing
a dependency this package documents as an internal detail, and pinning a
behaviour it reserves the right to change.

Everything raised on this package's own behalf now derives from
:class:`EndoxaError`. That is a rule with a test behind it rather than a
convention: ``tests/test_error_surface.py`` reads every ``raise`` in the source
and fails on one that does not.

Each class also derives from the built-in exception a caller would reach for
without knowing about this module -- ``TypeError`` for a sort mismatch,
``ValueError`` for an argument out of range. Catching either the built-in or
:class:`EndoxaError` works; the second tells you *whose* failure it was.
"""


class EndoxaError(Exception):
    """Base for every error this package raises on its own behalf.

    Deliberately not raised directly. It exists to be caught: ``except
    EndoxaError`` is the one clause that separates "this library refused" from a
    ``TypeError`` that came from somewhere else in the same block.
    """


class RuleSyntaxError(EndoxaError, ValueError):
    """A rule, axiom or formula string that could not be parsed.

    Carries the offending text, and chains the underlying parser error as its
    cause: ``raise ... from`` keeps the grammar's own diagnosis reachable through
    ``__cause__`` for anyone who wants the column number, without making the
    parser part of this package's public surface.

class SortMismatchError(EndoxaError, TypeError):
