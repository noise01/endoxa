"""The grammar of a ground atom.

A predicate's identity is ``predicate`` + ``arity``, and reading that identity
out of an expression string like ``mortal(socrates)`` is something several parts
of the library need to do identically. This module is its single home, so two
callers can never disagree about what an atom is.

Pure and dependency-free -- stdlib only, importing nothing else in doxa -- so it
sits below everything.

**Two narrower parsers remain elsewhere, deliberately.**
:mod:`doxa.governance.revision.facts` and :mod:`doxa.governance.revision.engine`
each read atoms with a stricter pattern: theirs tolerates no whitespace around
the parenthesis and drops empty terms, so ``p (a)`` and ``p(a,,b)`` mean
something to them that they do not mean here. Folding those in would *widen* the
grammar the revision path accepts, which is a change of behaviour rather than a
tidy-up.
