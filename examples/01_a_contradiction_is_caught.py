"""An agent contradicts itself twenty turns apart, and the ledger notices.

The claims do not conflict on their face: one is about Socrates being human, the
other about Socrates not being mortal. What makes them a contradiction is a rule
the agent was given, and finding that out is a question about a set rather than
about either claim -- which is why noticing it is not something the thing that
lost track can be asked to do.
